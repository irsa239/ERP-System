✅ Definition of x-model
x-model is used for two-way data binding.
This means:

✅ Whatever you type in an input will update the variable.

✅ And if that variable changes in JavaScript, it will update the input value too.

🔁 Two-Way Binding Example
html
Copy
Edit
<div x-data="{ name: '' }">
    <input type="text" x-model="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
    <p>Your name is: <strong x-text="name"></strong></p>
</div>
🟢 What Happens:

As soon as the user types something in the input field, the variable name is updated.

The <strong x-text="name"> shows the live value of name.

🔍 Used In Your ERP System (Search Example)
html
Copy
Edit
<input
    type="text"
    x-model="query"
    @input.debounce.300ms="fetch results"
>
🟢 Here:

query is the variable.

Whatever user types is stored in query.

The system uses it to fetch live search results.
